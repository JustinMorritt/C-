C++ Assignment 1

1) Using one of the three loops in C++, write a program that displays a table
for squares and cubes for the integers from 0 to 10.  The program output should
look like this:

Number  Square  Cube
======  ======  ====
0       0       0
1       1       1
2       4       8
3       9       27
4       16      64
5       25      125
6       36      216
7       49      343
8       64      512
9       81      729
10      100     1000

(hint: use the tab chatacter ('\t') to get this formatting).

2) Discuss the choice of loop you made for this program.   Could have used
another kind of loop?  Would another kind of loop been more or less appropriate?

Bonus:

Implement exactly the same table using the other two kinds of loops.
