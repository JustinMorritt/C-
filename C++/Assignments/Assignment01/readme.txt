- What you didn't accomplish.

1) Building ********************************************************************
I plan on building this example by including the "iostream" library of functions.
My code will consist of a loop that will execute starting from 0 and ending at 10.
First I will initialize a main function and make sure it returns zero at the end.
Secondly I will write some lines of text to the standard cout function.
Then I will start the for loop initializing a int variable named I with a value of 0
The second argument in the for loop will consist of when I less then or equal to 10.
The third argument will just be ++i incrementing the I each time the loop passes.
Within the scope of the loop i will have it display i, i*i, then i*i*i.
As the program executes the i will increase, thus displaying new results until 
the bound scope of this loop reaches 10.

2)pseudo-code********************************************************************
Setup 
	display the type of loop used in a cout statement
	display the number , number squared, number cubed
	display a line seperating the results
begin
	initialize a for loop with 
		argument1
			int i = 0
		argument2
			while i <= 10
		argument3 
			increase i by 1   == ++i
	Scope of loop : display in standard cout
			i , i * i, i * i * i with \t (tabs) in between.
	when i reaches 10 it breaks from loop.
end

3)Accomplishments*****************************************************************
	What I achieved in this assignment is a printout of numbers that begin at 1
and end at 10 while also displaying the squared and cubed versions of the number.
By using a loop you can accomplish the entire printout without manually entering 
the squared and cubed versions of the numbers. You can also change the number 10
to any number you feel like and get a printout up to that number. I also implemented
this structure into the other two loop styles.

4)Non-Accomplishments*************************************************************
I could of created it quicker...also with a system where a user inputs the Max number of
times to loop. Other then that I accomplished everything including the Bonus's.
